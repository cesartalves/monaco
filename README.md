# Monaco

Monaco is a really small library for running [Monte Carlo
experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'monaco'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install monaco

## Usage

Simulations accept two things: the number of trials to run, and the
block to execute in each trial. The block should return true if an event
has occurred, and false if it hasnâ€™t.

In this example we simulate throwing five dice, and check for the event
that any three dice show the same value:

	simulation = Monaco::Simulation.new(trials: 100_000) do
		dice = 5.times.map { rand(1..6) }
		dice.any? { |d| dice.count(d) == 3 }
	end

	probability = simulation.run
	# => (19290/100000)

The `run` method returns a rational number, which can be converted to
a float using `to_f`:

	probability = simulation.run.to_f
	# => 0.1929

The default number of trials is 10,000. Trial blocks are passed the
number of the currently executing trial.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the
`.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
